## Why I Chose This Theme

I chose to create a Bloodborne-inspired text adventure because of it's my personal favourite game of all time. Everything from its Environment, Lore, Combat Mechanics, Voice overs are awe inspiring and I have been in love with it ever since I played it first. Although this is a very humble project but I enjoyed doing it and hope I could expand upon it in someway by including better Conversations with NPC's using the technologies like LLMs in following Homeworks
